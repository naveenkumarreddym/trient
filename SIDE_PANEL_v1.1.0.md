## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Reload Extension
```
1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Find "Trient Agent"
3. Click 🔄 RELOAD
4. Version should show 1.1.0
```

### Step 2: Open Side Panel
```
Method 1: Click extension icon
- Click the Trient Agent icon in toolbar
- Side panel opens on the right

Method 2: Right-click
- Right-click extension icon
- Select "Open side panel"

Method 3: Keyboard shortcut (if set)
- Use your configured keyboard shortcut
```

### Step 3: Use the Agent
```
The side panel is the central hub for user interaction. It now operates independently for each browser tab, allowing for parallel task execution without interference.

### Independent Per-Tab Operation

To support running multiple automations at once, the side panel architecture has been updated to be fully tab-aware:

1.  **Tab-Specific Activation**: The side panel is no longer enabled globally. It is programmatically enabled and opened only for the specific tab where the user clicks the extension icon.
2.  **Context Isolation**: Each side panel instance is tied to a unique `tabId`. The background script maintains a `Map` where each tab's ID is a key for its own isolated context, including the current task, action history, status, and final results.

This ensures that the UI in one tab will not reflect the state or history of a task running in another tab.

### Core Functionality

The side panel allows users to:
1. Configure API key
2. Enter task
3. Click "Start Task"
4. Watch it work while panel stays open!

## 🎨 Visual Changes

### Layout
- **Full height**: Panel uses entire browser height
- **More width**: Can expand to see more details
- **Resizable**: Drag the edge to adjust width
- **Scrollable**: History section scrolls independently

### History Section
- **More space**: Max height increased to 400px (from 200px)
- **Better visibility**: Can see more actions at once
- **Still scrollable**: Long histories scroll smoothly

### Background
- **Gradient header**: Beautiful purple gradient at top
- **Clean white body**: Easy to read content
