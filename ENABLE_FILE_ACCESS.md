# 🔓 Enable File Access for Test Pages

## Issue

Getting error: "Cannot automate this page type" when trying to use the extension.

## 📊 What Page Are You On?

The extension now shows you the **exact page type** causing the issue. Check the error message - it will say something like:

- ❌ "Cannot automate Chrome internal page" (chrome://...)
- ❌ "Cannot automate Empty/blank page" (about:blank)
- ❌ "Cannot automate Extension page" (chrome-extension://...)
- ✅ Regular website should work (http:// or https://)

## ✅ Quick Fix - Use These Pages

### Option 1: Test on a Real Website (EASIEST)

Just navigate to any regular website:
```
1. Open a new tab
2. Go to: https://example.com
3. Click the extension icon
4. Try task: "Click the More information link"
```

### Option 2: Use Google
```
1. Go to: https://www.google.com
2. Click extension icon
3. Try task: "Search for Python tutorials"
```

### Option 3: Use Wikipedia
```
1. Go to: https://www.wikipedia.org
2. Click extension icon
3. Try task: "Search for Artificial Intelligence"
```

## 🧪 To Use test-simple.html (Local File)

If you want to test with the local `test-simple.html` file:

### Step 1: Enable File Access
```
1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Find "Browser-Use Chrome Extension"
3. Click "Details" button
4. Scroll down to "Allow access to file URLs"
5. Toggle it ON ✅
```

### Step 2: Open the Test File
```
Method A (Drag & Drop):
1. Find test-simple.html in your chrome-plugin folder
2. Drag it into a Chrome window
3. Should open with file:/// URL

Method B (Open File):
1. In Chrome: File → Open File (Ctrl+O / Cmd+O)
2. Navigate to chrome-plugin folder
3. Select test-simple.html
```

### Step 3: Verify It Works
```
1. Press F12 (open Console)
2. Should see: [BrowserUse] Content script initialized
3. Click extension icon
4. Try task: "Click the test button"
```

## 🚫 Pages That WON'T Work

These page types **cannot** be automated by extensions:

❌ **Chrome Internal Pages**
- chrome://extensions/
- chrome://settings/
- chrome://newtab/
- Any chrome:// URL

❌ **Special Pages**
- about:blank
- about:config
- chrome-search:// (Chrome's search page)
- New Tab page (unless it's a regular website)

❌ **Extension Pages**
- chrome-extension:// URLs
- Extension popups
- Extension options pages

✅ **Pages That WILL Work**
- http:// websites
- https:// websites
- file:// URLs (if "Allow access to file URLs" is enabled)

## 🔍 Debug: What Page Am I On?

Not sure what page you're on? The error message now tells you!

**Check the error in the extension popup** - it will say:
```
Cannot automate [PAGE TYPE].

Current URL: [YOUR ACTUAL URL]

Please navigate to:
• A regular website (http:// or https://)
• Or open test-simple.html from your file system

Examples: google.com, example.com, wikipedia.org
```

## 📝 Quick Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Easiest (No Setup)
```
URL: https://example.com
Task: "Click the More information link"
Result: Should navigate to iana.org ✅
```

### Test 2: Search Engine
```
URL: https://www.duckduckgo.com
Task: "Search for browser automation"

```

### Test 3: Wikipedia
```
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page

```

### Test 4: Local Test File (Needs File Access)
```
URL: file:///path/to/chrome-plugin/test-simple.html
Task: "Click the test button"
Result: Should show success message ✅
```

## 🎯 Best Practice

**For testing the extension**, use real websites rather than local files:
1. ✅ Easier - no file access needed
2. ✅ More realistic - tests real-world scenarios
3. ✅ Better - tests with actual web content

**Only use local files if:**
- You need offline testing
- You're developing new features
- You want controlled test environment
