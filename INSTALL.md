## üîß Troubleshooting

### Extension Doesn't Load

2. Verify `manifest.json` is valid (no syntax errors)
3. Ensure icons folder exists with all three PNG files
4. Check Chrome console (F12) for specific errors

2. Click it to see all extensions
3. Pin Browser-Use to toolbar for easy access
4. Check if extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`

### API Key Errors

**Problem**: "Invalid API key" or similar errors

**Solutions**:
1. **Verify key format**:
   - OpenAI: starts with `sk-`
   - Anthropic: starts with `sk-ant-`
   - Google: Long alphanumeric string
2. **Check key is active**:
   - Make sure you copied the entire key
   - No extra spaces before/after
3. **Verify credits**:
   - Check your account has available credits/quota
4. **Test key directly**:
   - Try using the key in provider's playground
5. **Create new key**:
   - Sometimes regenerating helps

### "Could not establish connection" Error

**Problem**: Messages fail to send between components

**Solutions**:
1. **Refresh the webpage**:
   - Press F5 or Ctrl+R
2. **Reload extension**:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click reload icon on the extension card

   - Reload page, try again with clearer instructions

### Elements Not Found

**Problem**: "Element with index N not found"

### High API Costs

**Problem**: Spending too much on API calls

**Solutions**:
1. **Use efficient models**:

   - Extension already limits to 100 steps
3. **Stop failed tasks**:
   - Don't let failed tasks run forever
4. **Be specific**:
   - Clear instructions = fewer steps = lower cost

### Actions Don't Execute

**Problem**: Actions fail silently or with errors

**Solutions**:
1. **Check website compatibility**:
   - Some sites actively block automation
   - Banking/payment sites often don't work
2. **Disable extensions that might conflict**:
   - Ad blockers
   - Privacy extensions
   - Other automation tools
3. **Try incognito mode**:
