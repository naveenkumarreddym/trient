## 🐛 Still Not Working?

### Check Console Logs

**On the webpage (F12 → Console):**
```
Look for:
✅ [BrowserUse] Content script initialized
✅ [BrowserUse] Content script ready
✅ [BrowserUse] Received message: get_state
✅ [BrowserUse] Found X interactive elements

If you see ❌ errors instead, copy them!
```

**In Extension Background (chrome://extensions/ → "service worker"):**
```
Look for:
✅ Task starting...
✅ Injecting content script... (if needed)
✅ Thinking...
✅ Executing: [action type]

If you see ❌ errors instead, copy them!
```

### Common Error Messages

| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| "Could not establish connection" | Reload extension + refresh page |
| "Element with index X not found" | Be more specific in task description |
| "LLM API Error" | Check your API key and credits |
| "No response from content script" | Refresh the page, wait for full load |
| "Failed to initialize" | Can't automate chrome:// pages |

## 📝 Task Writing Tips

### ❌ Vague (Won't Work Well)
```
"Click button"
"Fill form"
"Find stuff"
```

### ✅ Specific (Works Better)
```
"Click the blue Submit button at the bottom of the form"
"Fill the email field with test@example.com"
"Find the first product price on this page"
```

### 💡 Pro Tips
```
- Wait when needed: "Wait 2 seconds, then click X"
- Scroll first: "Scroll down, then click the footer link"
- Be explicit: "Click the red button that says 'Delete'"
- One step at a time: Don't try to do too much at once
```

## 🔄 Full Reset (If Nothing Else Works)

```
1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Remove "Browser-Use Chrome Extension"
3. Close ALL Chrome windows
4. Reopen Chrome
5. Go to chrome://extensions/
6. Enable "Developer mode"
7. Click "Load unpacked"
8. Select the chrome-plugin folder
9. Refresh your target page
10. Try again
```
